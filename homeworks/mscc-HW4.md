1. Continuous deployment x continuous delivery
    1. _Main issues:_ 
    2. _Benefits:_
        - Continuous deployment:  Since it is considered the next step of continuous delivery, if in your company the application acceptance tests are automated and the tests before this one are also automated, the application is deployed automatically to production. That means there's no need of "human intervention" or IT limitations, so the continuous deployment is possible to apply.
        - Continuous delivery: The guarantee of a safe and fast code deployment, since it is almost all about rigorous automated tests, delivering every change to a production-like environment.
    3. _Differences:_ The continuous deployment cannot be possible if there are some requirements, agreements, IT limitations or even the need to wait for another feature to go live first. Additionally, it cannot happen if there's no continuous delivery.
